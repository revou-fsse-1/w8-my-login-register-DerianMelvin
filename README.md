# Login/Register Website

![banner](assets/markdown_banner.png)

## 👋 Greetings!

This is a simple Login/Register website using designs from the previous website project [RONDO](https://rondobags.netlify.app/). The goal was to implement validation checks when user creates an account or sign in to a website, and how user manages data using CRUD operations. I learn a lot by working on this project and I hope you do too ✌️.
